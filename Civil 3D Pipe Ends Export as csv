In this code:

We use StreamWriter to write to a CSV file.
Each pipe's name and its start and end points' coordinates (X, Y, Z) are written as a line in the CSV file.
The CSV file is created in the same directory as the Civil 3D drawing file. The filename is temp.csv.
To use this code, follow the same steps as before to integrate it into Civil 3D:

Create a new Class Library project in VB.NET in Visual Studio.
Add references to the required AutoCAD and Civil 3D .NET assemblies.
Add this code to a class file in your project.
Compile the project to generate a DLL.
Load the DLL into Civil 3D using the NETLOAD command and run the ExportPipesToCSV command.
This will generate a temp.csv file in the directory of your Civil 3D drawing, containing the exported pipe data.
